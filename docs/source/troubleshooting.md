# Troubleshooting

## Known issues

-   On Mac OS X, the nextflow log reporting (`-with-report`) may not work with Nextflow v0.31.1. This should be fixed in future Nextflow releases.
-   If the DNA damage levels are too low, mapDamage may crash.
-   If you run into the following error `CondaVerificationError: The package for openjdk located at...`, running `conda clean --all` might fix it
